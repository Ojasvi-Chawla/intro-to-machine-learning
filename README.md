# intro-to-machine-learning
This is my first Machine Learning project where I implemented a Linear Regression  and other Machine Learning algorithms model using Python.
The goal of this project was to understand the fundamentals of supervised learning, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

-Import and clean datasets
-Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
-Train a Linear Regression model
-Evaluate model performance using metrics
-Visualize predictions

As this was my first ML project, it helped me learn not only how to build a model but also how to identify common pitfalls like overfitting and data leakage. 
These lessons significantly improved my understanding of building robust and reliable machine learning systems.

Lessons Learned:
-Importance of proper train-test split
-Avoiding data leakage
-Handling overfitting with regularization or validation

🛠 Technologies Used
🔹 Programming Language:
-Python
🔹 Libraries & Tools:
-NumPy (for numerical computations)
-Pandas (for data manipulation)
-Matplotlib (for data visualization)
-Scikit-learn (for Linear Regression model)
-Jupyter Notebook (for implementation)
