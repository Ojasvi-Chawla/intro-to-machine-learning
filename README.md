# intro-to-machine-learning
This is my first Machine Learning project where I implemented a Linear Regression  and other Machine Learning algorithms model using Python. The goal of this project was to understand the fundamentals of supervised learning, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

-Import and clean datasets
-Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
-Train a Linear Regression model
-Evaluate model performance using metrics
-Visualize predictions
